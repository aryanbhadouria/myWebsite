<h1>Hobbies/Extracurriculars</h1>
<h4>These are the top 7 most important activities I do outside of school. All of my EC's are because I take interest in them, which is why I refer to them as my hobbies.
I'm also in several clubs but I chose what was most important to me :). Enjoy. (Scroll Down)</h2>

      <h1 class="w3-text-black">Robotics</h1>
      <p>I've been doing robotics since late 6th grade with Team 9128, the Mounties. Originally I joined the team the age threshold to compete so I helped
	  out with menial tasks such as looking for parts or cleaning the working area. Robotics is my passion and I discovered this through joining this team,
	  for which I am forever thankful. I am now Team Captain of our great team and part of the software squad of the robot. I was also recently a Dean's List Semi-Finalist Nominee 
	  and also interviewed for Mount's Communication magazine regarding robotics and technology in general. 
	  </p><p>
	      The essay my teacher, Mr. Simard, used to nominate me for the award is:</p><p>
	      "Aryan has displayed a passion for computer science and robotics since he arrived at school 5 years ago. While he could not compete due to age restrictions, he attended every Saturday morning with the team and would help out in any way needed, including sweeping the floor or just retrieving needed parts. Aryan works hard as a school leader, and is part of the student leadership team that organizes and implements many of our functions. He is always working to recruit new members for the team and is quick to offer his knowledge of what gracious professionalism means by his stellar example! His grades mentioned above speak volumes for his desire and passion to learn. He currently is part of an entrepreneur program in Boston, Mass, and is utilizing those skills to help raise needed funds for our program. I am quite confident in my nomination for this very important award, and assure you he is and will continue to be a great ambassador for all that is great about First!" </p><p>
	          
 I am still waiting for my results, as they are announced at states, which will be in February.

      <h1 class="w3-text-black">Guitar</h1>
      <p>I've been playing the guitar for 3 years. I really like playing it as it is soothing and the idea of plucking strings to create melodious songs is very
	  interesting to me. My favorite song to play, though basic, is "Spanish Theme". It is my favorite because it is very simple and it sounds reallllly good (in my opinion).
	  I only used the E string and only notes F and G.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-black">Volunteer Work</h1>
      <p>I've completed around 102 hours since the beginning of 2019. I've spent my time volunteering at places I care about so I know that the time
was used wisely. I volunteered at <a href ="http://www.bskst.org/">a local temple,</a> for the <a href ="https://48in48.org/">48in48 foundation </a> 
, and an autism camp called  <a href =https://www.autismri.org/events/camp-wannagoagain> Camp Wannagoagain </a>. Volunteering at these places helped me learn a lot about
myself, my culture, technology and html coding, and how to deal with other people well.

      <h1 class="w3-text-black">Starting Company/TYE</h1>
      <p>Earlier last year I applied to an entreupreneurship program <a href=https://www.tye-boston.org> TYE </a>, where we learn about what it takes
	  to start a business and then make one ourselves. A couple of friends and I in the program met up and decided to start our company, Achilles Heal.
	  The name is from Achilles' heel, the Greek story about the warrior. The company is going to make a better way for trainers to communicate to kids
	  that were injured in their sport. We are making an index for the trainer to refer to while training the student to make the process pleasant for both
	  the trainer and the athelete. This is a great learning experience for me, as I would like to start my own company when I'm older.

      <p>I joined Troop 14 Boy Scouts in 6th grade and have been part of it ever since. I am on a break right now since I have a lot going on right now but I will return soon.
	  I'm First Class ranked. My experiences at scouts have taught me to appreciate the Earth and to put things back to where you found them. It taught me to be 
	  comfortable in uncomfortable situations. I have lots of merit badges because I like learning more and more skills.

      <h1 class="w3-text-black">Lacrosse</h1>
      <p>I've decided to pick up lacrosse this year and I'm very excited to play this spring. I've been practicing consistently and have never felt this interested about a sport ever. I train with Martin Bowes at Compete Academy. This is a short clip of me practicing wallball, trying to hit the backboard 50 times in under a minute. I unfortunately didn't get it in this video, but when I recorded myself I realized I wasn't utilizing my wrist enough, but I learned from my mistakes later and achieved my goal of 50.</p>
